# Detach Database

This process will result in only detaching the database from the server, but will keep the mdf and ldf files within the physical location.

## 2 ways to detach a database

1. Using `sp_detach_db` stored procedure
    ```sql
    Exec sp_detach_db @dbname = 'Playground'

    -- Did not show statics data
    Exec sp_detach_db @dbname = 'Playground', @skipchecks = 'true'

    -- Showed some statics data to in the message tab, related to updating some sys tables
    Exec sp_detach_db @dbname = 'Playground', @skipchecks = 'false'

    -- No clue did not see any message
    Exec sp_detach_db @dbname = 'Playground', @keepfulltextindexfile = 'true'

    -- No clue did not see any message
    Exec sp_detach_db @dbname = 'Playground', @keepfulltextindexfile = 'false'
    ```

2. Using `SQL Server management studio`
    - Right click on the **Database** which you would like to detach
    - Select **Task** option from the context menu
    - Then select **Detach** option from the sub context menu
    - Once the dialog opens select **Drop Connection** checkbox and click OK
    - Refresh server instance(optional), you will not see the database as it has been detached
